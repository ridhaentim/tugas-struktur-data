# C-1.21
# Write a Python program that repeatedly reads lines from standard input until an EOFError
# is raised, and then outputs those lines in reverse order
#  (a user can indicate end of input by typing ctrl-D).

# done = False
# lines = []
#
# while not done:
# try:
#         line = raw_input('Enter text, i shall print it in reversed order, ctrl-d to stop')
#         lines.append(line)
#     except (EOFError):
#         for l in range(len(lines) - 1, -1, -1):
#             print(lines[l])
#             done = True
